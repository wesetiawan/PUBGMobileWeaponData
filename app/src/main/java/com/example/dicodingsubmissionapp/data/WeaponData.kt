    private val weaponDescription = arrayOf("A powerful assault rifle that uses 7.62mm ammunition, this rifle does more damage than the 5.56mm assault rifles and comes with a kick to match. In regards to attachments, the AKM is identical to the M16A4 in that it can only accept a muzzle, magazine and sight attachment. It is best used in single-shot mode except when attempting to breach buildings with it. At close to medium ranges, it is notable in that even if a target is wearing a military vest and/or Spetsnaz helmet, it only takes a maximum of five shots to kill. It is also capable of killing a Spetsnaz helmet wearer in two shots by landing a shot on the head, then finishing them off with another shot to any other part of their body. The AKM will deal maximum damage within 50 meters, beyond that distance damage will continually decrease out to 290 meters. Thus, it is not recommended to engage sufficiently armored players at longer ranges as the recoil and lower bullet velocity compared to other rifles will prove landing consistent hits difficult.",
        "The Beryl M762 is a versatile assault rifle with more attachment points than the AKM, on par with the SCAR-L. Its base damage per shot is slightly lower than the other 7.62mm assault rifles, offset by its rate of fire being almost as fast as that of the Groza, allowing its overall damage per second to be significantly higher than the comparable AKM. This comes at the cost of significantly higher recoil that — unlike the AKM — can be reduced by attaching foregrips.",
        "Tidak Di ketahui",
        "Right at home in its central European origins, the G36C's damage per second is lower than its popular 5.56mm brother, the M416. But it makes up for what it lacks in DPS, with better control especially when engaging your enemies at short to medium range ",
        "Compared to the other 5.56mm assault rifles, in its unmodified state the M416 is fairly similar to the others besides its slightly faster rate of fire compared to the SCAR-L, however its strong points are the fact that it can accept the most modifications of any of the assault rifles, accepting muzzle, magazine, stock, lower and upper rail attachments, as well has having exceptional stability, only bested by the AUG. A fully modified M416 is therefore highly sought after as its very low recoil allows for controllable fully automatic fire, even with a 4x ACOG Scope attached. The M416 will deal maximum damage out to 60 meters, with damage reaching a minimum at 445 meters.",
        "The M16A4 can select between single fire or burst fire mode, which fires off a burst of three rounds. Much like the AKM, it can only accept muzzle, magazine and sight mods. Despite the lack of attachments, it is a very stable weapon with minimal recoil and as such excels at ranged combat, particularly since it has one of the fastest bullet velocities in the game, reducing the need to compensate for gravity and bullet travel time, making this weapon ideal for close to medium-long range combat. Burst mode can be devastating in close quarters combat as the delay between bursts is exactly the same as its delay between individual shots, allowing it to have the fastest rate of fire of all the assault rifles. Compared to the other 5.56mm rifles, the M16A4 has relatively low recoil and in the hands of a skilled operator, its burst mode allows it to potentially have the fastest fire rate of any assault rifle, however this is countered by the fact that the recoil occasionally jumps sideways, making it slightly harder to use. The M16A4 can only accept sights up to the 6x Scope, limiting its use as a long-range sharpshooting rifle.The M16A4 will deal maximum damage out to 50 meters, after which damage begins to decrease to its minimum value at 390 meters.",
        "The SCAR-L is a relatively stable assault rifle, with a rate of fire that, together with its moderately low recoil, allows it to be easy to control. With a vertical grip and compensator the rifle can comfortably be used on full auto even with a 4x scope. The most noticeable drawback is its restrictive iron sights, so finding a reflex sight or scope should be a priority when finding this weapon. It also has the slowest bullet speed of the 5.56mm rifles, although this is still much faster than the 7.62mm rifles. The slow bullet speed and relatively mediocre stats of this gun are compensated by the fact that this gun has the furthest minimum damage falloff distance of all the non-crate assault rifles and that gunfire from this weapon is quieter compared to the other assault rifles. The SCAR-L will deal maximum damage out to 70 meters, reaching its minimum at 495 meters.",
        "The QBZ-95 is a Chinese bullpup assault rifle that fits the theme/location of the Sanhok.",
        "The AUG A3 (Armee-Universal-Gewehr—A3), an air drop-only weapon, and for good reason - its exceptional handling and high muzzle velocity make it a highly sought after weapon for anyone fortunate enough to come across a crate and get away with its contents alive. The AUG utilizes the same attachment points and even has the same ballistics as the SCAR-L[1], albeit with a higher muzzle velocity and slightly increased drag coefficient meaning that bullets fired from this gun will have a slightly more curved trajectory, canceled out by the fact that the bullets travel much faster compared to the SCAR-L. A major drawback of the AUG however is its relatively slow reload time, with a tactical reload alone having a duration of 3 seconds, thus a quickdraw magazine will be vital. Its rate of fire is also relatively slow, which allows for better stability but somewhat reduces its capability in close quarters combat. When equipped with a compensator and foregrip, the AUG has slightly more overall stability compared to an equally equipped M416. The AUG will deal maximum damage out to 70 meters. Damage starts to decrease past that point, with the maximum damage falloff at 482 meters.",
        "Dealing the same damage as the AKM and boasting the second-highest rate of fire of all assault rifles, only bested by the M16A4, it can turn the tables around for whoever is lucky enough to get their hands on this rare weapon, particularly in the final stages of the match. While this weapon could be deemed overpowered, it has one major drawback: an abysmal reload time of 3 seconds when performing a dry reload. It is therefore advised to not empty the entire magazine, however its rate of fire in a firefight may make this rather difficult, so the next best option would be checking that the area around is secure enough to warrant a fresh magazine in the gun. Quickdraw magazines can also help mitigate the long reload time. Other drawbacks are its inability to accept foregrips of any kind, or any telescopic sights stronger than a 6x scope, reinforcing its use as a close-quarters weapon. Backing this up is the fact that the only muzzle attachment it can take is a suppressor. These flaws only serve to represent the power of the Groza, and it is therefore advised to prioritise players using this weapon, especially when there are less than 10 players alive. The long reload time can be seen as an opportunity to move in for the kill, provided that the target doesn't have a backup weapon such as a Saiga-12K. The Groza will deal maximum damage out to 80 meters, decreasing to its minimum at 490 meters.",
        "The Winchester Model 1894 is a starting medium to long range rifle that uses .45 ACP rounds. It is a guaranteed knock down in case of a head shot, when the victim does not have a level 2 helmet or higher. The only attachments available for the rifle are sniper rifle bullet loops(allowing for quicker reload speed), making it only useful for very early game.",
        "The Kar98k is highly sought after because of its ability to deal fatal damage against players wearing level 2 helmets, with only level 3 helmets able to protect their wearers from one shot kills assuming they are at more than 85% health. Because of this, it is a very good weapon for long-range engagements without having the risk of going to airdrops for the other bolt-action sniper rifles. Its main drawbacks are its slow reload time when reloading, with full reloads only being somewhat faster than reloading bullets individually, and its rather slow bullet velocity compensated with higher damage, making it more challenging to engage distant enemies, particularly if they are on the move. The Kar98k will deal maximum damage out to 100 meters after which point damage will decrease, reaching its minimum at 485 meters.",
        "The AWM is a powerful bolt action rifle designed for extreme range sharpshooting. Dealing the highest amount of damage out of any gun in the game, it is also one of only two ranged weapons (the other being the crossbow) capable of killing any player in one shot to the head, even if the victim is wearing a Spetsnaz helmet. At distances beyond 500 meters, it becomes the only gun in the game that can kill players in one shot to the head. The long reload, time between shots, high damage and unique ammo all represent the high risk, high reward gameplay that requires the user to have patience and a steady aim, moving position quickly after firing, lest other players recognizing the firing sound of the AWM attempt to close in to take the weapon for themselves. The AWM will deal maximum damage out to 150 meters, with maximum damage falloff at 679 meters.",
        "A lightweight rifle classified as a designated marksman rifle in terms of attachments, compared to other weapons in its class, the Mini-14 deals less damage and only has attachments for muzzle, magazine and sight mods, making up for these shortcomings with a very high muzzle velocity - the highest of any weapon in the game - and low bullet drop, as well as a larger magazine capacity, making it suitable for situations where quick follow up shots are required at long range, as well as close quarters combat when the trigger just needs to be pulled as fast as possible, hoping that the enemy is the first to go down. It has a rather lengthy reload time so make sure the area is secure before inserting a fresh magazine. The Mini-14 will deal maximum damage out to 90 meters. Damage will continually decrease beyond that point, reaching its minimum value past 420 meters.",
        "The QBU is a Chinese bullpup designated marksman that fits the theme/location of the Sanhok. The rifle features a bipod that deploys upon proning. When deployed, the bipod significantly reduces the recoil when shooting.",
        "The SKS (Samozaryadny Karabin sistemy Simonova) is a designated marksman rifle, being a middle ground between a typical assault rifle and a sniper rifle. Thus, this rifle excels in medium-range combat and packs devastating stopping power if a user can handle this gun effectively in CQC (close-quarter combat), but will be less effective in long- to extreme-combat as it lacks the precision of dedicated sniper rifles. Players who wish to use a weapon with high damage, rate of fire and long range effectiveness should look for the SKS, as it is one of the few weapons with such properties.This gun also has the benefit of accepting the most attachments out of all the sniper rifles. The SKS shown and used in PUBG is a Chinese F.D.E. version made by Tapco. The SKS is not without its downsides however. Its standard capacity magazine of only 10 rounds, combined with high recoil and high precision compared to the automatic rifles require the user to stand still in order to land consistent shots, which in turn makes them an easy target. Use this to your advantage if you know your attacker is using one of these. Another thing to keep in mind would be counting shots in the magazine; if you hear the enemy shoot off 10 shots, you can use that time to change your position or advance on the shooter, although there is the risk that they have extended mags on the gun and may simply be waiting for you to expose yourself.",
        "The SLR can be seen as a more powerful version of the SKS, dealing more damage at the expense of more recoil. Unlike the SKS however, it lacks an attachment point for any foregrips, requiring the user to have good recoil control and steady hands. Given that its initial bullet velocity is higher than that of the SKS as well as the fact that it also reloads slower, the SLR is more suited to ranged combat where there is ample cover and time to engage enemies. The length of the weapon may become an issue in close range engagements or when attempting to peek in and out of cover constantly.",
        "The VSS Vintorez is a rarely spawning weapon shooting common 9mm ammo in both single and fully automatic firing modes. It deals very low damage compared to other sniper rifles, but because of the integrated suppressor, muzzle report is significantly reduced, while the subsonic ammo causes its bullets to make a quiet whizzing noise rather than a supersonic crack, making it extremely difficult to locate the shooter. Because of the use of subsonic ammo, the weapon has a very low muzzle velocity at 330 m/s, compared to the Mini-14 at 990 m/s, making long distance shots and shots against moving targets difficult. Its maximum effective range is 400m with most efficient performance at 200m - users must still keep in mind that at this range, it will take an approximate two thirds of a second to travel to its target. While its subsonic ammo has low velocity and high drop, the rangefinder of the integrated scope allows for precision shots as it has distance markings for both standing and crouching targets. Once the distance between the user and the target has been found, the scope's chevrons can then be used to compensate for bullet drop, with the center chevron representing 100 meters, and the following chevrons increasing by 100m each. Despite the poor damage, the VSS can prove very useful in the end-game because of closer ranges, particularly with an extended magazine, coupled with the most effective suppressor in the game, making detection very difficult even during close quarters combat. The VSS is currently the only ranged weapon to not feature any damage drop-off whatsoever, meaning that maximum damage is dealt even at distances far beyond that of the scope's rangefinder markings.",
        "The M24 can be seen as another option after the Kar98k, with lower damage but higher muzzle velocity, it has slightly more deviation when not aiming down the sights. Being loaded via magazines, tactical reloads will be faster compared to the Kar98k's one-by-one reload, although full reloads with the M24's standard magazine will be slightly slower compared to a full reload with the Kar98k. Nevertheless, the M24 is a valuable weapon that should be prioritized for its ability to deal large amounts of damage at great distances. The M24 will deal maximum damage out to 120 meters. Beyond that distance, damage will decrease, reaching its minimum damage value at 580 meters.",
        "The Mk14 can be seen as a bigger version of the SKS - dealing more damage per shot and with more recoil as well. The most notable difference from the SKS is the ability of the Mk14 to switch to an automatic fire mode, enabling its wielder to deliver a huge amount of damage for different situations, whether it be house-clearing or surprise contact with another player. The high recoil limits the effectiveness of this function to close ranges however, and the already low magazine capacity coupled with the lengthy reload duration requires the user to have a very steady aim when going full auto, particularly if there is more than one enemy around. The bipod reduces recoil when shooting from a prone stance and thus encourages its user to locate a position from which they can fire upon targets with relative safety, delivering quick and powerful follow up shots to finish them off. The Mk14 will deal maximum damage out to 120 meters, with minimum damage being dealt past 488 meters.",
        "A slow but hard hitting machine gun, its distinctive 47-round pan magazine strikes a balance between the firepower of a full-power cartridge with the support capability of a machine gun. Its slow cyclic rate of fire means that its relatively strong recoil is somewhat manageable. Being a vintage weapon, it lacks attachments, being only capable of accepting sights up to the 6x scope, allowing greatly increased range for supporting fire. The bipod can be enabled by going prone, greatly reducing recoil compared to firing from a standing or crouched position, allowing more precise shots against distant targets. The DP-28 will deal maximum damage out to 50 meters, with damage falling off out to 298 meters, at which point bullets will do minimum damage.",
        "With 100 rounds of 5.56mm ammo per magazine, the M249 excels at room clearing, dealing slightly more damage than the 5.56mm assault rifles with a rate of fire as fast as that of the M16A4. The recoil is somewhat low, however the high rate of fire makes it harder to control. The bipod can be enabled by going prone, greatly reducing recoil compared to firing from a standing or crouched position, allowing more precise shots against distant targets when telescopic sights are used. All these advantages come with downsides however - as a belt-fed weapon that loads from cumbersome box magazines, it has the longest reload time of any weapon in the game, with a tactical reload just passing the 7 second mark, thus great care must be taken before choosing to reload, either ensuring that the area is fully secure before reloading or staying alert for anyone attempting to move in, or carrying a suitable backup weapon. This gun also burns through ammo very fast, particularly when keeping targets pinned behind cover, therefore it is advisable to stock up on as much 5.56mm ammo as can be carried if planning to use this weapon for extended engagements. The M249 will deal maximum damage out to 75 meters, beyond that distance damage will begin to decrease, reaching its minimum value at 385 meters.",
        "This weapon excels at taking out enemies right after landing from the plane, while everyone is still focused on finding gear. Its high rate of fire also makes it an excellent room clearer, although this also makes it uncontrollable at longer ranges. Since the weapon deals the least damage out of all the SMGs, using this weapon during mid- to end-games is usually not recommended because most players will be equipped with better armor and guns. When fully modded with extended mags, a stock and a compensator, this gun becomes quite controllable and can be surprisingly viable in the final stages of the game, although the extremely high rate of fire will burn through ammo quickly if many shots miss.",
        "The UMP45 deals the second highest damage of all the SMGs, right behind the Tommy Gun, making it a very viable late-stage gun when fitted out with attachments. Its already controllable recoil can be reduced even further with a foregrip and compensator, although stealthy players may opt for a suppressor instead since it already has minimal recoil to begin with.",
        "Firing the slow but hard-hitting .45 ACP cartridge, this vintage submachine gun deals the most damage out of all the SMGs, however the inability of this gun to attach sights, coupled with its relatively strong recoil makes it a challenge to use, even in close quarters combat. Extended magazines are highly recommended as the reload time remains unchanged, while magazine capacity is almost doubled.",
        "The Vector, with its low recoil and average damage is most useful in close to mid-range combat. Boasting a very high rate of fire and low recoil, this gun also has the benefit of having the most attachment slots of all the SMGs to further increase its performance. The major downside to this gun is — aside from it being less powerful per shot than the UMP45 — its rather small magazine capacity of 19 rounds. Thus, extended magazines are a must for anyone wishing to use this gun further into the match.",
        "Right at home in its Eastern European origins, this weapon is exclusive to Erangel and Vikendi. While in full-auto, its best suited for quick and accurate sparring in close-range. Because of the unique helical magazine that runs along the barrel, this SMG doesn't support magazine upgrades or lower rail attachments. However, the weapon has high firing stability built-in, which allows for low recoil even without a grip. With only a muzzle and sight attachment to add, you'll have a fully kitted and reliable short-range weapon in your hands faster than ever before. The Bizon is quiet but deadly 9mm submachine gun, the Bizon is best suited for quick but accurate sparring in close-range, but keep in mind that it comes with a bit of a kick. Though its overall damage per sound is lower than the UMP9 and Vector its large magazine and reduced sound will have you covered in situations that call for a quick sneak attack in close quarters.",
        "What the S12K lacks in range, it makes up in sheer volume. The S12K is a devastating weapon at close range while its semi-automatic action makes killing multiple enemies easier than with its pump-action or double-barrel counterparts. The weapon also has an advantage over other shotguns in its reloading time due to being magazine-fed. While its rate of fire allows four shells to be discharged within one second, the extreme recoil means putting multiple consecutive shots into the intended target difficult.",
        "The S686 offers unparalleled burst damage in CQB due to its ability to almost instantaneously fire two 12-gauge shells, but it quickly loses damage at range unless equipped with a choke, and has a very long reload time, making dealing with enemies at range or more than one enemy difficult. Although it is tied with the sawed-off shotgun in that both have the lowest ammo capacity of the shotguns in the game, the S686 has the fastest rate of fire of all the shotguns, allowing for skilled users to potentially gain an upper hand in otherwise unfortunate situations. When fitted with a choke, the S686 can perform surprisingly well at distances up to 15m. The low ammo capacity leaves no room for error however, as a missed shot can mean a quick death. Damage falloff starts off immediately. Beyond 285 meters, targets will not take any damage at all.",
        "The S1897 excels in clearing houses with the simple point-and-shoot principle, its spread allowing a greater probability of hitting the target. Careful aim is still essential since missing one shot can easily result in death due to the time required to rack the pump. With a choke attached, the shotgun gains considerable range in the form of 25% tighter spread, being able to take out opponents from a fairly long distance. The reduced spread means reduced effectiveness in close quarters combat however. The duckbill choke has the opposite effect, spreading the pellets over a wider horizontal area, increasing effectiveness at close range.",
        "The smallest shotgun available in the game, the Sawed-off functions like a pocket S686, albeit with higher spread due to the short barrel. It has two barrels, side-by-side, and as such can hold two rounds. Like the S686, it can quickly fire off both barrels to quickly do a lot of damage. The Sawed-Off has the highest potential damage of any handgun, but also the lowest potential damage and depending on the distance to the target. It has the shortest effective range of all handguns, and is really only useful shortly after landing or in point-blank CQB situations.",
        "A full-sized machine pistol that occupies the sidearm slot, the Skorpion is very controllable for such a weapon, even when fired in full auto. With a 20 round magazine as standard and capable of being increased to 40, it can serve as a dependable pocket SMG to free up the other weapon slots for more powerful guns. It should be noted however that its inability to accept quickdraw or extended quickdraw magazines leave it with a rather lengthy reload time for a sidearm.",
        "The P18C is a automatic secondary and because of this it's the lowest damaging pistol in the game. Despite this, it actually boasts the highest damage per second of all the pistols, even rivaling submachine guns in terms of utility. The P18C is the best secondary in the game in terms of putting down lead downrange in a hurry and can even sometimes be used as a primary if you wish to do so. The high rate of fire means a good amount of damage per second but with a rather high recoil, so users might use the P18C with attachments such as sights and barrel attachments. This weapon is not suitable for long-range engagements, but as a backup pistol, you can be sure to put targets full of holes if you can control it.",
        "The P1911 packs a punch in a small package. Its damage output is limited only by the small magazine size and the skill of its operator. It is therefore advisable to find an extended or extended quickdraw magazine as soon as possible if planning to keep this weapon as its magazine capacity is almost doubled, greatly increasing its potential as a backup weapon. Due to its slow muzzle velocity of 250 meters per second, it is inadvisable to use this gun at ranges further than 50 meters. Damage falloff begins after the bullet has traveled one meter and will continually decrease for as long as the bullet is in flight.",
        "The P92 is the middle ground of the pistols, with a balance of firepower and ammo capacity. With a modest rate of fire and steady hands, this pistol can quickly determine the winner in early game fights while everyone is rushing to find guns. It makes a good backup weapon for emergencies and while extended magazines may seem tempting due to the capacity increase, quickdraw magazines may prove more beneficial for users who frequently reload, at least until extended quickdraw magazines can be found. Damage will continually decrease out to 832 meters, past that point absolutely no damage will be dealt to unarmored targets.",
        "The R1895 is one of the most challenging weapons to use, in that it has severe drawbacks that usually negate its benefits. Its extremely long reload time (with empty reloads being almost as slow as reloading an M249), inability to mount a red dot sight and fire rate slower than any of the other pistols make it a last resort weapon in nearly every situation, unless when sneaking up on players. Damage will continually decrease for as long as the bullet is in flight.",
        "A powerful revolver that can be seen as Miramar's version of the R1895, it has one less round than the R1895, but reloads with a speedloader instead of loading individual rounds, greatly reducing reload time. It also uses the common .45 Ammo instead of 7.62mm rounds. Like the R1895, it can only accept one type of attachment, but instead of a suppressor it can only mount a red dot sight instead, allowing for a clearer sight picture, although the existing sights are relatively clear compared to the R1895. Damage will continually decrease for as long as the bullet remains in flight.")
